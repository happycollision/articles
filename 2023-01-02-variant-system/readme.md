This article was written for the Trilliant Health Medium account. Medium has an
unfortunate way of not quite rendering 80 characters across in code examples, so
all the code blocks in the article need to be shorter line lengths to avoid the
need for readers to do a horizontal scroll.

Since I don't want my entire editing experience to be less than 80 characters,
I've set up prettier to format code files at a shorter length.

Medium is also pretty damn bad at a copy/paste of markdown that includes code
blocks, so leaving these in separate files anyway seems fine, since I'll have to
copy/paste multiple times anyway.

Medium also _helpfully_ changes em dashes to hyphens when you copy from their
online editor. So going back and forth between their editor and this file causes
some real subtle loss in formatting there. So instead of using actual em dashes,
I am resorting to two hyphens (which is what their editor accepts as a
placeholder for an em dash.) I guess I'll use three hyphens whenever I want an
en dash.
