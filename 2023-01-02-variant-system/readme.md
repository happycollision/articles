This article was written for the Trilliant Health Medium account. Medium has an
unfortunate way of not quite rendering 80 characters across in code examples, so
all the code blocks in the article need to be shorter line lengths to avoid the
need for readers to do a horizontal scroll.

Since I don't want my entire editing experience to be less than 80 characters,
I've set up prettier to format code files at a shorter length.

Medium is also pretty damn bad at a copy/paste of markdown that includes code
blocks, so leaving these in separate files anyway seems fine, since I'll have to
copy/paste multiple times anyway.
